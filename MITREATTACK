# T1592 - Gather Victim Host Information

## MITRE ATT&CK Tactic: Reconnaissance

**ID**: T1592  
**Tactic**: Reconnaissance  
**Platform**: All  
**Permissions Required**: None  
**Data Sources**: Web analytics, Network protocol analysis, File monitoring

## üîé Description

Adversaries may gather information about the victim's hosts that can be used during targeting. This technique typically occurs in the early phases of a cyber operation. Information about hosts may include:

- Assigned IP addresses
- Hostnames
- Operating systems (OS)
- System architecture
- Roles of the host (e.g., web server, mail server)
- Running services
- Network interfaces

This data allows adversaries to identify potential targets for exploitation and determine how best to access them.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Example Tools & Techniques

| Tool/Method                | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| WHOIS                     | Retrieves domain registration details                |
| nslookup / dig            | Gathers DNS records and server info                  |
| Shodan / Censys           | Provides data on exposed devices and services        |
| Banner Grabbing           | Identifies services running on open ports            |
| Port Scanning (e.g., Nmap)| Detects live hosts and open ports                    |

## üîê Defensive Measures

- Monitor DNS, WHOIS, and web traffic for anomalies  
- Block suspicious external recon attempts  
- Enforce strict access control on internal host data  
- Monitor logs for enumeration patterns

## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage in Red Team / Pentest

During red team operations or penetration tests, this technique is commonly used to:

- Enumerate exposed infrastructure
- Identify running services and versions
- Prioritize targets based on their roles or vulnerabilities

Example:
```bash
nmap -sV -O 192.168.1.0/24
